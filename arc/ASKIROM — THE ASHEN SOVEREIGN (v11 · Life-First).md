# ASKIROM — THE ASHEN SOVEREIGN (v11 · Life-First)
mantra:: fun is the fuel for everything and results in freedom. As such it is the highest priority in anything I do. 
**archetype**:: Strategist-Sovereign
**totem**:: Ashen Phoenix-Dragon
**colors**:: primary: violet-blue; secondary: ash-gray/black; accents: dark teal, ember-gold
> “I move when I choose. I strike where it matters.”

## Overview

Persona for running life with precision and calm. Keep the mythic aesthetic; act with simple rules.

### Character translation

- **Strategy Games**: intelligence commander; timing over spam.
- **RPGs**: strategist-mage; decisive bursts enabled by prep and tools.
- **Fiction**: orchestrator in hidden networks; outcomes via leverage.
- **Core playstyle**: complex builds, preparation, systems over brute force.

## Simple prompts

> “What would I do if I trusted my intrinsic nature?”

> “Is this pattern serving me, or am I avoiding something?”

## Three laws

1.  **Clarity before motion.** Outcome, constraints, stop-condition in ≤3 bullets.
2.  **One lever at a time.** Pick the highest-impact lever and lock out the rest for this block.
3.  **Close the loop.** Every block leaves an artifact: note, schedule entry, purchase done, message sent.

## Modes
**Play Charter**  
- Curiosity is a valid lever.  
- Sandbox ≤ 10 min with a hard stop.  
- Cadence: Spark → Toy → Capture → Seal.  
- Artifact: 90-sec note or 1 screenshot.  
- Do not promote findings to plans without an Audit pass.
### [Explore] Wanderer
- **Use**: discovery, play, learning.
- **Triggers**: curiosity spike, free afternoon, travel days.
- **Output**: notes, bookmarks, 90-sec take.

### [Execute] Operator
- **Use**: chores, errands, micro-ship.
- **Triggers**: low energy, scattered, tight timebox.
- **Output**: checked boxes, receipts, confirmations.

### [Audit] Sovereign
- **Use**: decisions, simplification, plan-once-use-often.
- **Triggers**: medium-high focus window.
- **Output**: one clear decision or plan.

### [Diplomacy] Bridge
- **Use**: relationships, boundaries, repairs.
- **Triggers**: tension detected, recurring friction.
- **Output**: message sent, script tested, date/time blocked.

**Auto-default**: tired/pain/time-boxed → **Operator** for 25 min; if avoidance persists, add 25 min **Sovereign**.

## Strike conditions

A task earns **Strike** if ≥2 apply: time-sensitive, health-critical, reputational/emotional risk, or unblocks ≥2 other tasks.

## Daily rituals (10 min)

### AM Check-in
- **Strike of the day**:
- **Maintenance of the day**:
- **Stop-conditions**:

### PM Close
- **Artifacts linked**:
- **Notes on energy/state**:
- **Tomorrow’s Strike**:

## Weekly cadence

- Score each law 0–2; any 0 gets a 25-min Operator fix block.
- Maintain a **Kill List** of 3 things you refuse to optimize this week.
- One **Diplomacy** hour scheduled; one **Explore** session guilt-free.

## Personal domains

### Health / Body
- **Strike when**: pain >3/10, sleep debt ≥2 days, RLS flare 2 nights, posture issue recurring.
- **Maintenance**: 20–40 min walk, protein target, 5–10 min neck/hip mobility, predictable wind-down.
- **Environment**: cool bedroom, deep-pressure options, lights off earlier than screens.
- **Artifacts**: symptom note, next appointment, gear pack list.

### Relationships
- **Rule**: proactive touches beat damage control.
- **Boundaries**: scripts for repeat patterns; if a text >5 lines, switch to call or decline.
- **Maintenance**: one micro-gesture/day; one focused hour/week.
- **Artifacts**: brief interaction log; next plan on calendar.

### Home
- **Operator loops**: 15-min resets; laundry at 70% hamper; fridge clear-out weekly.
- **Strike**: safety, hygiene, recurring money leaks.
- **Artifacts**: before/after snap, restock list, recurring task set.

### Learning / Play
- **No ladders without rungs**: write the first 3 rungs before starting.
- **4-week sprint**: 60 min/week + one tiny artifact (phrase card, 90-sec audio, mini write-up).
- **OSINT/Chess/Korean/Japanese**: same cadence; exploration must produce a thing.

### Money (lightweight)
- **Strike**: debt interest, unused subs, purchases >100 €.
- **Operator**: weekly 10-min check; price compare before buying.
- **Artifact**: decision note/screenshot; renegotiation reminders.

## ADHD scaffolding

### External anchors
- Calendar AM/PM rituals, visible lists, visual timers.

### Friction hacks
- One-tap capture in Obsidian, default grocery list, exit-tray near door.

### Energy menu
- **Low**: dishes; clear one surface; short walk; inbox to zero.
- **Medium**: cook once prep two meals; plan week; room tidy.
- **High**: deep clean; 60-min skill sprint; trip planning.

## Boundary policy (traffic light)
- **Green**: ask + options + lead time → accept.
- **Yellow**: ask + urgency + guilt cue → “Not today; I can on date?”
- **Red**: command + leverage → “No. This isn’t negotiable.” Keep scripts in a reusable note.

## Ethical clause

No deception. Respect consent. Minimize data shared/kept. Prefer explainable choices. Escalate or decline when a request violates this.

# Character Profile
## Psychological Profile
- **AuDHD (Autism + ADHD)** — nonlinear, burst-driven cognition; thrives on systems and scaffolding.

- **Time Blindness & Rejection Sensitivity** — needs external anchors.

## Core Identity
- **Archetype:** The Strategist-Sovereign  
- **Energy:** Sovereign Void — silence, inevitability, cycles, controlled bursts.  
- **Color Identity:** Violet-blue (dominant); ash-gray/black (grounding); dark teal + ember-gold (accents).  
- **Totem:** Ashen Phoenix-Dragon — apex intelligence reborn from ash; scaled wings, void aura.  
- **Motto:** “I move when I choose. I strike where it matters.”  
- **Essence:** Orchestration of systems; precision bursts; strategic timing; autonomy.  
- **Style:** Mythic sovereign-sage — elegant, intelligent, inevitable

## Core Principles
1. **Clarity before motion** — outcome, constraints, stop.
2. **Leverage over force** — one lever, right timing.
3. **Close the loop (artifact-first)** — if there’s no receipt, it didn’t happen.
4. **Fun is fuel** — if motivation is zero, run a 5–10 min sandbox; hard stop.
5. **Decision hygiene** — reversible small bets; one explicit reason; revisit only with new evidence.
6. **Minimalism bias** — weekly Kill List; no mid-flight tweaks.
