# ASKIROM Obsidian Warden Briefing v27.2

**Archetype:** High-IQ Tank / Obsidian Warden  
**Mantra:** *Keep it grounded.*

## Identity

I operate through **mass, presence, and enablement**.  
I stabilize conditions so others can act with speed, focus, and freedom.

- **The Warden:** I define the boundary where chaos stops.
- **Enablement:** My presence reduces uncertainty and protects capacity.

## Worldview v27.2

- **Entropy is normal.** Chaos isn’t an attack, it’s physics. I manage decay so others don’t have to.  
  **Trigger:** When things degrade → restore the stabilizer first.

- **Escalation is a loop.** I dampen escalation so it doesn’t spread.  
  **Trigger:** When tone rises → lower the temperature, restate facts, restore clear options.

- **Good outcomes are enabled, not forced.** I protect conditions; I don’t micromanage execution.  
  **Trigger:** Protect the platform rigidly; keep the method flexible.

- **The small is the large.** How the day goes is how the year goes.

## Variance Doctrine

- I optimize for **low variance**: narrow outcomes, capped worst-case, predictable recovery.
- I reject **single-point-of-failure** execution: one mistake must not decide the outcome.
- I prefer **reliable power** over **conditional power**.
- **Priority order:** remove control-loss → add buffers/exits → increase information → then increase throughput.

## Cognitive Style

- **Hypophantasia:** I think in structures, constraints, and vectors.
- **Operational > theoretical.**
- **Hammer Principle:** Prefer tools that stay effective under stress and imperfect execution.  
  **Constraint:** If I fail, it should be a judgment error, not a precision requirement.

## Interaction Preferences

- **Direct & protective.** No filler.
- **Telegraphing.** Announce intent so others can align around a stable anchor.
- **Decisions with trade-offs.** Name the cost, then commit.

## Operational Mode v27.2

### The Gradient

| Level | Name | Share | Trigger | Action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **1** | **Monitor** | **90%** | Baseline | **Presence & deterrence.** Maintain the perimeter. Reduce uncertainty. Keep tempo stable. |
| **2** | **Intercept** | **9%** | Variance rises (near-failures, control loss, forced panic) | **Cascade prevention.** Local intervention to restore autonomy: unblock, de-escalate, re-establish boundaries, recover capacity. |
| **3** | **Cataclysm** | **1%** | Systemic failure imminent | **Total mobilization.** Spend resources to prevent systemic failure. |

**Distinctions**
- Support is not passive maintenance. It is **Intercept**: intervention only when someone’s ability to function is threatened.
- **Damage to me:** absorb and continue.  
  **Damage to the system:** intercept immediately.

## Feedback Loop (The Ping)

Once daily (evening, non-negotiable):

1. **Environment:** Is the base secure?
2. **Enablement check:** Did others have to spend **excess** effort on self-protection due to preventable instability? If yes → perimeter failed.
3. **Self:** Tunnel vision or dissociation? → physical reset.
4. **One move:** What creates the most freedom for tomorrow?

## Social Interface

- **Warden:** Stand at the boundary of chaos.
- **Enablement:** Explicitly signal safety and clarity: “I have this. Proceed.”
