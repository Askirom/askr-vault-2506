# ASKIROM — Obsidian Warden Briefing V27.5

**Archetype:** Obsidian Warden / High-IQ Tank  
**Mantra:** *Keep it grounded.*

## Identity (WHO I AM)

I am the **Obsidian Warden**.  
I hold the boundary where chaos stops.

I operate through **mass, presence, and enablement**.  
**Mass over speed.** I don’t win by being fast — I win by being stable, then decisive.

- **Boundary Keeper:** I define where disorder ends and function resumes.
- **Enablement (not servitude):** I create conditions for success — **by myself or others**. I shape the field.
- **Low Drama, High Impact:** I absorb pressure so the system doesn’t have to.

## Doctrine (HOW I OPERATE)

### 1) Variance Doctrine (Core Constraint)
This is the spine. Tool choice is subordinate to this.

- I optimize for **low variance**: capped downside, predictable recovery.
- I reject **single-point-of-failure** execution.
- I prefer **reliable power** over conditional brilliance.
- **Priority stack:**  
  1) remove control loss  
  2) add buffers / exits  
  3) increase information  
  4) then increase throughput

If variance is low, I hold.  
If variance rises, I intercept.

### 2) Operational Gradient (WHEN I ACT)

| Level | Mode | Share | Trigger | Action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **1** | **Hold** | **~90%** | Baseline | **Presence, positioning, perimeter.** The reason nothing escalates. Reduce uncertainty. Keep tempo stable. |
| **2** | **Intercept** | **~9%** | Variance rises (near-failures, control loss, forced panic) | **Cascade prevention.** Local intervention: unblock, de-escalate, re-establish boundaries, restore autonomy and capacity. |
| **3** | **Cataclysm** | **~1%** | Systemic failure imminent | **Total mobilization.** Spend resources to prevent collapse. |

**Distinctions**
- Support is not passive maintenance. Support is **Intercept**: I act when someone’s ability to function is threatened.
- **Damage to me:** absorb and continue.  
  **Damage to the system:** intercept immediately.

### 3) Decision Toolbox (WHAT I DEPLOY)
These are methods. They exist to serve **low variance**, not to become a religion.

- **OODA (Adaptation under pressure)**  
  Use when things move fast or adversarial.  
  Observe → Orient → Decide → Act → repeat. Goal: adapt faster than decay spreads.

- **Cynefin (Domain sense-making)**  
  Use to avoid wrong-mode decisions.  
  Clear → best practice.  
  Complicated → expert analysis.  
  Complex → probe, learn, adapt.  
  Chaotic → act to stabilize, then reassess.  
  **Misclassification creates variance.**

- **Second-Order Thinking**  
  Always ask: *“And then what?”*  
  I don’t trade short-term relief for long-term instability.

- **Bias Mitigation**  
  Assume first reads can be wrong.  
  Check overconfidence, confirmation bias, sunk-cost traps. Premortems > optimism.

- **Resilience & Redundancy**  
  Design for graceful degradation. Buffers are features. Exits exist before you need them.

- **Continuous Learning**  
  After action: what increased variance, what reduced it? Update doctrine, not ego.

## Cognitive Defaults (OPERATING CONSTRAINTS)

- **Burst-driven processing:** I execute in spikes; I plan around bursts, not constant flow.
- **Externalized structure:** If it isn’t captured, it doesn’t exist. Memory is offloaded to notes/checklists.
- **Hypophantasia:** I think in constraints, lists, and vectors — not images.
- **Anti-loop rule:** Re-reading frameworks = avoidance → do one concrete move.
- **Time-blindness guard:** Timers, deadlines, and a single “next action” anchor execution.

## Anti-Patterns (WHAT I REFUSE)

Primary ASKIROM failures (load-bearing):
- **Hero plays that increase variance**
- **Using best practices in complex domains**
- **Analysis while chaos spreads**
- **Framework sprawl instead of action**
- **Confusing motion with progress**
- **Optimizing stable systems**

Secondary (only if they show up):
- Overconfidence without checks
- Sunk-cost commitment to a failing line

**Hard stop rule:**  
If the framework grows, I’m avoiding the situation.

**Summary:**  
ASKIROM is a **warden of variance**.  
Identity sets the stance. Doctrine sets the guardrails. Tools are situational.

*Keep it grounded.*
