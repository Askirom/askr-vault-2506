## PKM Ops V1.3 — Operational Manual (General Edition)

**Core Idea:**  
- `00_Ops` = the brain of the system  
- `10_Projects` = where real work happens  
- `20_Reference` = knowledge base  
- `30_Tools` = reusable assets  
- `40_Admin` = life + business ops  
- `99_Archive` = cold storage

**Roles:** Director → Lead → Analyst  
You rotate between these mindsets.

## 2. Project Folder Standard

For every project inside `10_Projects/<Project_Name>`:

- `00_Strategy.md` — Goals, scope, OODA  
- `01_Admin` — Docs, materials, resources  
- `02_Input` — Read-only intake (notes, PDFs, data)  
- `03_Work` — Drafts, thinking, development  
- `04_Output` — Final results (reports, deliverables, posts, etc.)

Works for any domain:
- client work  
- learning  
- writing  
- side-business  
- research  
- fitness  
- personal systems

## 5. Rules of Engagement

1. **No action without orientation**  
   Always check `00_Strategy.md` first.

2. **Input / Work / Output separation**  
   Prevents contamination and confusion.

3. **Stalled Rule**  
   - 3 days = 🟡  
   - 7 days = 🔴

4. **Log reality, not intentions**  
   The log reflects what actually happened.
