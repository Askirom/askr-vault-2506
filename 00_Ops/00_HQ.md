### How to Run the HQ Workflow (Morning Routine)

You do this **once a day**, usually with your first coffee. It should take 3 minutes.

#### Step 1: The Health Check (Active Projects)
Look at your list of active projects. Don't think about *tasks* yet. Think about *momentum*.
* **Green (🟢):** It’s moving forward. You know what to do. *Decision: Let it ride.*
* **Yellow (🟡):** It’s stuck. Waiting on a client, missing info, or you are procrastinating. *Decision: Needs a nudge.*
* **Red (🔴):** It’s burning. Deadline missed or imminent crisis. *Decision: Drop everything else.*

#### Step 2: The Orders (Directives)
You only get **three slots**. This forces you to prioritize.
* *Bad Directive:* "Work on CLIFO." (Too vague).
* *Good Directive:* "Unblock CLIFO." (Strategic).
* **Rule:** If you have a **Red** project, Directive #1 must be fixing that Red project.

#### Step 3: The Scan (Radar)
Briefly look at the horizon.
* Is there a meeting on Thursday you need to prep for?
* Did you have a shower thought about a new service?
* *Action:* Just list them here so you don't forget. Do not act on them yet.

**Once this file is filled, you stop being the Director.**
You pick Directive #1, go to that Project Folder (`00_Strategy`), and switch to **Lead** mode.
