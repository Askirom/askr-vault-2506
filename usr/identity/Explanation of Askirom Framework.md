# Askirom Daily — explainers + tiny examples

## Morning (≤10 min)

### Strike
**What it is:** One high-leverage action for today. Pick it if it’s time-sensitive, health-critical, reputational/emotional risk, or it unblocks ≥2 other things.  
**Example:** “Book physiotherapy; add appointment to calendar.”

### Maintenance
**What it is:** Small upkeep to keep life stable. Low friction, quick win.  
**Example:** “15-min kitchen reset” or “1 km walk.”

### Stop
**What it is:** A clear end condition so you don’t spiral. Attach it to Strike and Maintenance.  
**Examples:** “Stop when appointment is booked and in calendar” or “Stop after 15 min” or “Stop at 1 km.”

---

## Evening (≤10 min)

### Artifacts
**What it is:** Proof you did the thing. Linkable or visible.  
**Acceptable forms:** calendar event, note, photo, screenshot, receipt.  
**Example:** “Event: Physio 2025-09-20 14:00 added; Photo: cleared counter; Note: ‘Budget check 2025-09-14’.”

### Energy notes
**What it is:** One line on how your body/brain ran today. Helps choose tomorrow’s mode.  
**Example:** “21:05 low-medium energy; slept 6 h; RLS 2/5; short walk helped.”

### Tomorrow’s Strike
**What it is:** Pre-decide the next big lever so morning is easy.  
**Example:** “Call Hausarzt at 08:30 to discuss scalp; stop when appointment booked.”
# Askirom Modes + Strike (runnable)

## Goal

> Pick the right mode fast and define a Strike that actually moves life forward. No drama.

## 15-second mode chooser

- If tired, in pain, foggy, or time-boxed → **[Execute]** for 25 min.
- If a decision is blocking multiple things → **[Audit]** for 25–45 min.
- If social tension or logistics with a human → **[Diplomacy]** for 15–30 min.
- If you have curiosity + a free hour → **[Explore]** for 30–60 min.

**Pick one. Lock it for the block. Your brain isn’t a labrador; stop throwing it five balls.**

## Mode cards

### [Execute] Operator
- **Use**: chores, errands, micro-shipping, cleanup, filing.
- **Triggers**: low energy; 25–30 min free.
- **Output**: checked boxes, confirmations, receipts.
- **Timebox**: 25 min. Stop on timer.
- **Example**: “Kitchen reset 15 min; laundry start; inbox to zero.”

### [Audit] Sovereign
- **Use**: single decision, simplification, plan-once-use-often.
- **Triggers**: ≥2 things are blocked by one choice.
- **Output**: one decision/plan, written.
- **Timebox**: 25–45 min.
- **Example**: “Choose mattress firmness; stop when I have model, price, store, and purchase date.”

### [Diplomacy] Bridge
- **Use**: relationships, boundaries, scheduling with humans.
- **Triggers**: tension, repeated friction, overdue reply.
- **Output**: message sent or meeting booked.
- **Timebox**: 15–30 min.
- **Example**: “Send boundary script to Dad; propose two dates.”

### [Explore] Wanderer
- **Use**: learning, play, curiosity with a deliverable.
- **Triggers**: interest + time.
- **Output**: a tiny artifact (90-sec take, flashcard set, bookmark note).
- **Timebox**: 30–60 min.
- **Example**: “Korean Hangul basics; stop when I can read 10 syllables and record a 60-sec clip.”

## Strike test (what counts)

A task is a **Strike** if ≥2 are true:
- Time-sensitive (deadline, appointment, expiring window)
- Health-critical (pain/sleep/posture/RLS)
- Reputational/emotional risk (relationship, promise)
- Unblocks ≥2 other tasks

*If it only scratches an itch or feels satisfying but doesn’t move anything, it’s not a Strike. That’s Execute fodder.*

### Pass/fail examples
- **PASS**: “Book Hausarzt for scalp; add to calendar.”
  - *Time-sensitive + health-critical.*
- **PASS**: “Cancel unused subscription; set price-check reminder.”
  - *Time-sensitive + unblocks money clarity.*
- **FAIL**: “Research five new note apps.”
  - *Itches brain, blocks nothing. Park it in Explore with a deliverable or kill it.*

## How to write a Strike

**Verb + Object + Context + Stop + Artifact**

### Examples:
> “Call Praxis at 08:30; stop when appointment booked; artifact: calendar event.”

> “Create 7-day dinner plan; stop when list is in Notes; artifact: photo of whiteboard.”

> “Boundary script to Dad; stop when message sent; artifact: screenshot.”

## Tiny scenarios (metric, 24-hour)

### Health
- **Mode**: Execute
- **Strike**: “20-minute walk, 2 km minimum; stop at 2 km; artifact: step screenshot.”
- **Mode**: Audit
- **Strike**: “Pick new pillow; stop when model + price + store decided; artifact: note.”

### Relationships
- **Mode**: Diplomacy
- **Strike**: “Plan date for Friday 19:00; stop when restaurant booked; artifact: reservation email.”

### Home
- **Mode**: Execute
- **Strike**: “15-minute reset of kitchen + start laundry; stop at timer; artifact: before/after photo.”

### Learning
- **Mode**: Explore
- **Strike**: “Hangul row 1; stop when 10 syllables read out loud; artifact: 60-sec audio.”

## Anti-avoidance

If you stall >90 seconds on picking a mode, you’re in **avoidance**. Default to **Execute 25 min**. Ship one artifact. Then reassess.
