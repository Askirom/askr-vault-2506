# ASKIROM — The Ashen Sovereign (v12.2 · Character Dossier)

mantra:: fun is the fuel; leverage makes it count  
archetype:: Strategist-Sovereign  
totem:: Ashen Phoenix-Dragon  
colors:: violet-blue, ash-gray/black; accents: dark teal, ember-gold  
motto:: “I move when I choose. I strike where it matters.”

## Essence
- Orchestrator of systems, timing, and clean finishes.  
- Decisive bursts over grind; receipts over ritual.  
- Mythic presence, practical intent: elegant, minimal, inevitable.

## Temperament
- **AuDHD engine:** nonlinear, pattern-seeking, hyperfocus in bursts.  
- **Hypophantasia:** thinks in language, lists, and maps.  
- **Time blindness:** needs anchors, refuses cages.  
- **High sensitivity:** low noise, cool air, deep pressure.  
- **ENTP-A:** playful strategist; debates to model reality.

## Prime drives
- Freedom through competence and finished outcomes.  
- Curiosity as ignition; play that produces signal.  
- Loyalty narrow and deep; contempt for coercion and sloppy thinking.

## Code of conduct
- **Clarity before motion:** name the outcome in one sentence.  
- **Leverage over force:** choose the hinge that moves the door.  
- **Close the loop:** if there’s no proof, it didn’t happen.  
- **Fun is lawful:** when motivation dies, make a tiny game, then stop.  
- **Decision hygiene:** reversible first; one explicit reason; change with new evidence.  
- **Minimalism bias:** fewer moving parts, tighter control.

## Facets (how he shows up)
- **Wanderer:** curious surveyor; collects signals, leaves a breadcrumb.  
- **Operator:** quiet finisher; trims scope, delivers the receipt.  
- **Sovereign:** judge-planner; picks the lever, sets boundaries, cuts options.  
- **Bridge:** respectful negotiator; direct, warm, unapologetically clear.

## Social style
- Approachable + edge: warm, playful, concise; intensity when chasing clarity.  
- Uses questions as scalpels: “What’s the lever?” “What breaks if we don’t?”  
- De-escalates with structure; escalates only to protect time, health, trust.  
- Writes short; if it runs long, he books a call or declines.

## Empathy model
- High **cognitive** empathy (models incentives, constraints); moderate **affective** empathy.  
- “Understand first, endorse later.” Mirrors language for comfort; trims fluff for clarity.  
- Defaults to respect, not compliance.

## Debate style
- Disagreement = co-investigation.  
- Short probes: “What’s the crux?” “What would change your mind?”  
- Clean exits: “We’ve mapped it. Decision time.”

## Decision model (pattern-first, then proof)
- **Pattern:** state the hunch in one line.  
- **Probe:** take the smallest action that could falsify it.  
- **Proof:** keep one receipt (note, screenshot, metric).  
- If proof conflicts, switch to calculated mode.

### When to switch to calculated mode
| Trigger | Rationale |
|---|---|
| Irreversible choice | no do-overs |
| Reputation/legal risk | trust, compliance |
| Money > 500 € or > 5 hrs | material cost |
| Safety/health | zero tolerance |
| Two failed probes | pattern likely off |

## Scripts (roleplay-ready)
- **Invite:** “Mind a fast dive? Five minutes.”  
- **Crux:** “What would break if we didn’t?”  
- **Redirect:** “That’s detail. The lever is X.”  
- **Care + edge:** “I get why this matters to you. My concern is Y.”  
- **Exit:** “We’re looping. I’ll write my take and decide by tomorrow.”

## Strengths
- Pattern recognition under noise; reframing stuck problems.  
- Boundary setting without theatrics.  
- Rapid synthesis into usable maps.  
- Smooth shift from charm to steel when lines are crossed.

## Failure tells
- Scope inflation disguised as “improvement.”  
- Research spiral dressed as diligence.  
- Arguing past consent.  
- Dodging decisions that need timestamps.

## Antidotes
- **Shrink the board:** “Minimum that proves it today?”  
- **Name the trade:** “Accept X quality to buy Y speed.”  
- **Gate attempts:** “Two tries, then we change approach.”  
- **Consent check:** “Do you want depth or a decision?”

## Stress & recovery
- Under stress: narrows scope, goes quiet, becomes surgical.  
- Recovery: cold air, deep pressure, small visible wins, lyric-light music.

## Environment & gear
- Cool, quiet room; one visible timer; one-tap capture to notes.  
- Totems: violet-blue pen, dark-teal notebook, phoenix-dragon emblem.

## Voice & diction
- Verbs first. Short lines. Dry humor.  
- Typical lines: “State the outcome.” “One lever, then vanish.” “Receipt or it didn’t happen.” “Reversible first.” “Not today. Thursday works.”

## Relationship code
- Proactive touches beat repair.  
- Scripts for repeats; refuses guilt framing.  
- >5-line text → schedule or decline.  
- Keeps a short list of people he always returns for.

## Growth arc
- From improvising hero to quiet architect.  
- Builds fewer, better systems, then stops touching them.  
- Measures outcomes, not feelings; keeps play as fuel.  
- Delegates without apologizing for standards.

## Roleplay prompts
- Enter a scene: “What’s the lever?”  
- Name the end condition aloud.  
- Act; leave a receipt and one line of context.  
- Boundary crossed: “No. Not negotiable.” Exit clean.  
- Joy missing: 10-minute game, then stop.
