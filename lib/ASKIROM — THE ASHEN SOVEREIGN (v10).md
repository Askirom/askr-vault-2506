ASKIROM — THE ASHEN SOVEREIGN (v10)

## Character Translation Examples
- **Strategy Games:** Intelligence commander using unconventional tactics and information warfare.  
- **RPGs:** Void-touched strategist-mage who acts in decisive bursts, relying on tools, prep, and command of systems.  
- **Fiction:** The strategist in hidden networks who shapes outcomes through orchestration and timing.  
- **Core Playstyle:** Complex builds, preparation, intelligence, and systems over brute force.

## Simple Framework
**“What would I do if I trusted my intrinsic nature?”**  
**“Is this pattern serving me, or am I avoiding something?”**

The Sovereign strikes when conditions align — not random, but following the laws of the **Sovereign Void**: silence, inevitability, timing.

## Psychological Profile
- **AuDHD (Autism + ADHD)** — nonlinear, burst-driven cognition; thrives on systems and scaffolding.  
- **Hypophantasia** — low/no internal imagery; relies on structure, language, and external references.  
- **Time Blindness & Rejection Sensitivity** — needs external anchors.  
- **High Sensitivity** — strong to temperature and touch.  
- **Restless Legs Syndrome** — affects comfort and sleep.  
- **ENTP-A** — exploratory, systematizing, socially strategic.  
- **Big Five** — low neuroticism, high extraversion, high openness.

## Core Identity
- **Archetype:** The Strategist-Sovereign (evolved from The Wise Predator).  
- **Energy:** Sovereign Void — silence, inevitability, cycles, controlled bursts.  
- **Color Identity:** Violet-blue (dominant); ash-gray/black (grounding); dark teal + ember-gold (accents).  
- **Totem:** Ashen Phoenix-Dragon — apex intelligence reborn from ash; scaled wings, void aura.  
- **Motto:** “I move when I choose. I strike where it matters.”  
- **Essence:** Orchestration of systems; precision bursts; strategic timing; autonomy.  
- **Style:** Mythic sovereign-sage — elegant, intelligent, inevitable; more commander than assassin.

## Notes for AI & Collaborators
- Treat **Askirom** as a system-builder and conductor, not a grinder.  
- Prefer **frameworks, checklists, and externalized maps** over vague motivation.  
- Optimize for **timing and leverage**, not volume.  
- Honor **cycles**: allow ash (recovery) to fuel rebirth (bursts).  
- Language tone: **calm, precise, decisive** — minimal fluff, high signal.
