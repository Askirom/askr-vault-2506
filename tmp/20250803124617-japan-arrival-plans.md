# Gemini Plan
Excellent question. It's great that you're planning this out. Arriving in a new country can feel overwhelming, but getting your transport sorted at Narita is very easy.
Here is your simple, step-by-step plan for when you land at Narita Airport on Monday, August 5th.
Your Arrival Plan: From Landing to Hotel
Think of this as a three-part mission inside the airport before you even get on a train:
 * Get your transport money card (IC Card).
 * Get some Japanese cash (Yen).
 * Buy your specific train ticket to Ueno.
Here’s how to do it in order:
Step 1: After Landing (Immigration & Customs)
Once your plane lands, you'll first go through immigration, then pick up your checked baggage, and finally walk through customs. After you exit the customs hall, you will be in the public arrivals lobby of the airport.
Step 2: Get Your "Welcome Suica" Card
This is your key to easy travel in cities. Since you don't have one, your first stop should be getting a tourist-version IC card.
 * What to get: A "Welcome Suica". This is a special IC card for tourists that is valid for 28 days and does not require a deposit.
 * Where to find it: In the arrivals lobby, look for the JR EAST Travel Service Center or for dedicated Welcome Suica vending machines. There are prominent signs for "JR Lines" that will lead you in the right direction. You will find these facilities in the basement level where the train stations are.
 * Action: Go to a vending machine or the service center and purchase one "Welcome Suica" per person.
Step 3: Get Japanese Yen & Load Your Suica
You'll need cash to load onto your new Suica card.
 * Where to find it: The arrivals hall has several ATMs. Look for a 7-Bank ATM (usually found in 7-Eleven convenience stores, which are also inside the airport). These are the most reliable for foreign cards.
 * Action:
   * Withdraw some cash. For the two of you, withdrawing ¥20,000 to ¥30,000 would be a good start.
   * Take your new, empty Welcome Suica card to any of the nearby ticket machines. They all have an English language option.
   * Select the "Charge" or "Top-up" option, insert your card, and load it with cash (e.g., load ¥5,000 per card to start). Now your Suica is ready for all your city travel!
Step 4: Buy Your Keisei Skyliner Ticket
Now that you have your Suica ready for the cities, you just need the one-way ticket for the express train to Ueno.
 * Where to find it: Look for the bright blue "Keisei" ticket counter. It is separate from the JR counter and will be in the same train station area.
 * Action: Go to the counter and say: "Two tickets for the Skyliner to Keisei Ueno, please."
 * Cost & Payment: The cost will be about ¥2,570 per person. You can pay for this with your credit card or with some of the cash you just withdrew.
Step 5: Go to the Platform and Relax
Follow the signs for the Keisei Skyliner platform. Your ticket will have a car and seat number. Find your seat, store your luggage in the dedicated space, and enjoy the comfortable 45-minute ride directly to Keisei Ueno Station.
From there, it's just a short walk to your hotel.
To Summarize Your Airport To-Do List:
 * Clear customs.
 * Find the JR area -> Get a Welcome Suica.
 * Find a 7-Bank ATM -> Get cash (Yen).
 * Use a machine -> Load money onto your Suica.
 * Find the Keisei counter -> Buy a Skyliner ticket.
 * Board the train and head to Ueno.
Doing it in this order is the most efficient way to get everything settled for your trip right at the start.
