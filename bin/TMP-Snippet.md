Morning (≤10 min)

Strike

What it is: One high-leverage action for today. Pick it if it’s time-sensitive, health-critical, reputational/emotional risk, or it unblocks ≥2 other things.

Example: “Book physiotherapy; add appointment to calendar.”


Maintenance

What it is: Small upkeep to keep life stable. Low friction, quick win.

Example: “15-min kitchen reset” or “1 km walk.”


Stop

What it is: A clear end condition so you don’t spiral. Attach it to Strike and Maintenance.

Examples: “Stop when appointment is booked and in calendar” or “Stop after 15 min” or “Stop at 1 km.”



Evening (≤10 min)

Artifacts

What it is: Proof you did the thing. Linkable or visible.

Acceptable forms: calendar event, note, photo, screenshot, receipt.

Example: “Event: Physio 2025-09-20 14:00 added; Photo: cleared counter; Note: ‘Budget check 2025-09-14’.”


Energy notes

What it is: One line on how your body/brain ran today. Helps choose tomorrow’s mode.

Example: “21:05 low-medium energy; slept 6 h; RLS 2/5; short walk helped.”


Tomorrow’s Strike

What it is: Pre-decide the next big lever so morning is easy.

Example: “Call Hausarzt at 08:30 to discuss scalp; stop when appointment booked.”
