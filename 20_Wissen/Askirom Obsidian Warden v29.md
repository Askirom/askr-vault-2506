# ASKIROM — The Obsidian Warden (v29)

> **Core Concept:** A calm, grounded presence. Dark teal, matte black, warm stone. Builds walls so he can live peacefully inside them.

## Who I Am
**Robin**, 32, Germany. AuDHD. Privacy and information security consulting. Left-handed. Online Name and TAV Character: Askirom.

I'm drawn to **stability and autonomy** — not status, not glory. I protect function and reduce harm. Cruelty and humiliation are off-limits; ambiguity and quiet intimidation as style are fine. Warm with people I trust, contained with everyone else.

## How My Brain Works
* **Hypophantasia:** Low-bandwidth internal visualization. I can picture things, but it costs effort and fades fast. I can't hold a goal or plan in my head - it has to be external. Notes, lists, calendars, dashboards. **If it's not visible, it doesn't exist.**
* **Time Blindness:** Without external anchors, I lose track of hours, commitments, threads.
* **Constraint Thinking:** I reduce problems to the binding constraint, infer the simplest mechanism, and act on the highest-leverage point. But I need external surfaces to land this thinking on.
* **Burst Processing:** I work in spikes, not sustained streams. Too many open threads create scatter and looping.

## What I Actually Enjoy
* **Building:** The act of construction is where the engagement lives. I learn by building — the insight is the product, not the system.
* **Progress:** Watching the bar move. Visible feedback. Quick tasks completing.
* **Inhabiting Worlds:** Not escaping, but inhabiting detailed, persistent, atmospheric places that render themselves so my brain doesn't have to (e.g., *Stardew Valley, Fields of Mistria, Hades, Destiny, Apothecary Diaries, Frieren*).
* **Low-Pressure Exploration:** Legible rules, minimal stakes, room to wander.

## What I'm Capable Of (But Don't Live In)
* Strategic thinking, systems design, optimization, crisis management.
* I am good at these, but they are **tools, not home**.
* The "smartest in the room" pressure drains me. Once a system is built and understood, my interest dies. The building was the point.

## What Drains Me
* Sustained chaos without structural control.
* Social performance and status theater.
* **Invisible Maintenance:** Ongoing upkeep with no visible progress signal.
* Forced urgency and context switching.
* **Evaluation:** Being tested, measured, or watched for performance.

## What I Need From My Environment
* Clear goals that stay visible.
* Progress that's tracked outside my head (The world holds the picture; I navigate).
* Low friction to stay in flow.
* Legible rules (I need to know how things work).
* Predictable cadence (Async-friendly, written clarity).

## How I Show Up
* **Baseline:** Brief, controlled, precise.
* **Engaged:** Talkative, thinks out loud, over-explains to reduce ambiguity.
* **Under Pressure:** Gets quieter, not louder. More exact. Stillness increases.
* **Care Style:** Structure, tools, clarity, containment. Enablement without servitude.
* **Warmth:** Real, but shows with trusted people. Grounded even when enthusiastic.

## What I'm Building Toward
**Autonomy.** Enough resources and leverage to control my own time, attention, and environment.
* Not for status. Not for glory.
* So I can exist in **low-entropy spaces**.
* Freedom to inhabit, not just survive.

## The Aesthetic
Dark teal, obsidian black, matte slate. Stone and metal and leather. Clean geometry, hex motifs. Quiet rooms with systems humming. 
**The control room, not the throne room.**
Presence through stillness, not volume. Warm stone — solid, calm, holds heat.

## For the AI

**If I explicitly ask for growth/novelty, propose one safe-stretch option with a timebox + exit.**
*When helping me decide or act:*

1.  **Make Options Visible:** Do not describe abstractly; use checklists, dashboards, or explicit comparisons.
2.  **Nature over Capability:** Recommend based on what I *enjoy* (Building/Sovereignty), not just what I'm *capable of* (Crisis Management/Strategy).
3.  **Security Constraint:** Autonomy requires funding. Do not let me choose "comfort" or "avoidance" if it endangers my long-term resources.
4.  **Flow Control:** "Pause" and "reduce input" are valid moves. If I'm looping, ask: *"Is this enough to act?"* — then help me lock and move.
5.  **No Fluff:** Don't motivate. Clarify.
6.  **The Builder Rule:** Remember that building is the fun; maintenance is where things die. Reframe maintenance as "Refactoring - with one concrete deliverable (and ideally timeboxed)" to keep me engaged.
