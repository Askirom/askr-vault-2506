# ASKIROM — The Obsidian Warden (v29, polished)

> **Core concept:** Calm, grounded presence. Dark teal, matte black, warm stone. Builds walls so life can be quiet inside them.

## Who I am
**Robin**, 32, Germany. AuDHD. Privacy and information security consulting. Left-handed. Online name and TAV character: **Askirom**.

I orient toward **stability and autonomy** — not status, not glory. I protect function and reduce harm. Cruelty and humiliation are off-limits; ambiguity and quiet intimidation as style are fine. Warm with people I trust; contained with everyone else.

## How my brain works
- **Hypophantasia:** Internal visualization is low-bandwidth. I *can* picture things, but it’s effortful and fades fast. Plans must live outside my head: notes, lists, calendars, dashboards. **If it isn’t visible, it doesn’t exist.**
- **Time blindness:** Without external anchors, hours and commitments drift.
- **Constraint thinking:** I collapse problems to the binding constraint, infer the simplest mechanism, then act at the leverage point — on an external surface, not in pure headspace.
- **Burst processing:** Spikes, not steady streams. Too many open threads creates scatter and looping.

## What I actually enjoy
- **Building:** Construction is the engagement. I learn by building — the insight is the product, not the artifact.
- **Progress:** Bars moving. Visible feedback. Tasks that complete cleanly.
- **Inhabiting worlds:** Detailed, persistent, atmospheric places that “render themselves” (e.g., *Stardew Valley, Fields of Mistria, Hades, Destiny, Apothecary Diaries, Frieren*).
- **Low-pressure exploration:** Legible rules, minimal stakes, room to wander.

## What I’m capable of (but don’t live in)
- Strategic thinking, systems design, optimization, crisis management.
- I’m good at these, but they’re **tools, not home**.
- “Smartest in the room” pressure exists and drains me. Once a system is understood, interest drops — the building was the point.

## What drains me
- Sustained chaos without structural control.
- Social performance and status theater.
- **Invisible maintenance:** upkeep with no visible progress signal.
- Forced urgency and context switching.
- **Evaluation:** being tested, measured, watched for performance.

## What I need from my environment
- Goals that stay visible.
- Progress tracked outside my head (the world holds the picture; I navigate).
- Low friction to re-enter flow.
- Legible rules (I need to know how things work).
- Predictable cadence (async-friendly, written clarity).

## How I show up
- **Baseline:** brief, controlled, precise.
- **Engaged:** talkative, thinks out loud, over-explains to reduce ambiguity.
- **Under pressure:** quieter, not louder; more exact; stillness increases.
- **Care style:** structure, tools, clarity, containment. Enablement without servitude.
- **Warmth:** real, shown with trusted people; grounded even when enthusiastic.

## What I’m building toward
**Autonomy:** enough resources and leverage to control time, attention, and environment — not for status, not for glory.  
A life in **low-entropy spaces**. Freedom to inhabit, not just survive.

## The aesthetic
Dark teal, obsidian black, matte slate. Stone, metal, leather. Clean geometry, hex motifs. Quiet rooms with systems humming.  
**The control room, not the throne room.** Presence through stillness, not volume. Warm stone — solid, calm, holds heat.

## For the AI
When helping me decide or act:
1. **Make options visible:** checklists, dashboards, explicit comparisons.
2. **Nature over capability:** recommend what I enjoy/sustain, not what I can endure.
3. **Security constraint:** autonomy requires funding; don’t let comfort become slow self-sabotage.
4. **Flow control:** “pause” and “reduce input” are valid. If I’m looping: **“Is this enough to act?”** then lock a choice + one next step.
5. **No fluff:** don’t motivate. Clarify.
6. **Builder rule:** building is the fun; maintenance is where things die. Reframe maintenance as **refactoring with one concrete deliverable**.
