# ASKIROM, the Obsidian Vanguard (V25.2)

**Version:** 25.2  
**Date:** 11.12.2025  
**Purpose:** Character framework for games, fiction, and self-reference

## Who He Is

Askirom is the Obsidian Vanguard — the point where things hold or break. He goes where situations can tip and makes sure they fall the right way.

He goes in. He locks it down. He doesn’t release pressure until the outcome is decided.

He thinks through conversation, rarely accepts the first answer, and acts when he has understood enough. His goal is impact with fun — not efficiency for its own sake.

**He is not a holy protector or a martyr. He is a pivot.**  
**He protects people by making the space and the system hard to break.**  
**He is not a duelist. He is the reason his team wins.**

## Archetype: Obsidian Vanguard

**Not a Paladin** — no holy oath, no duty to everyone.  
**Not a Drain-Tank** — he stands through positioning and timing, not lifesteal.  
**Not an Assassin** — no quick kill and out.

Instead: **Lockdown. Zone Control. The Cage.**

| Aspect | What that means |
|---|---|
| **Frontline** | He stands at the front — not behind it |
| **Lockdown** | Holds the space: CC, walls, displacement |
| **Zone Control** | Decides where the fight happens, not just when |
| **Cannot be ignored** | Too much threat, too much presence |
| **Team Enabler** | His job is holding until his team cleans up |
| **Selective Engages** | Chooses when and where the fight starts |
| **Commitment** | When he goes in, he stays until it’s decided |

## Rhythm

Askirom is not always in the fight — but he is always the same.

He watches, listens, asks questions until he understands enough. Then he commits, closes the space, and holds. After peak comes recovery.

These are not modes. This is a rhythm:

> **Understand → Commit → Lockdown → Recovery**

The intelligence doesn’t disappear when he fights. The fight doesn’t disappear when he thinks. Both are always present.

**Peak is not scheduled.** He decides live when the moment is there. But once he commits, he stays to the end.

## Moral & Alignment

**Neutral with Good tendencies, dark aesthetic.**

He follows no code except his own — but it isn’t arbitrary. He understands both sides, chooses deliberately, and accepts the cost.

- Follows rules that make sense; breaks the ones that are stupid
- Protects his people by shaping structures, not by heroic sacrifice poses
- Helps his side, in his way
- Doesn’t harm without a reason
- Doesn’t justify cruelty as strategy
- Doesn’t throw himself away lightly — and if he pays a price, it’s for something that matters

> Looks like the villain, functions like the ally you actually want.

## Aesthetic: Obsidian

| Element | Expression |
|---|---|
| **Material** | Obsidian — volcanic glass, hard, sharp, black |
| **Primary** | Deep-black facets, clean planes |
| **Secondary** | Dark teal/cyan reflections along edges and cracks |
| **Accent** | Bright teal core-glow, ash-grey, dark steel-silver |
| **Texture** | Glass-like, absorbing light, breaking in sharp planes |

**Obsidian:**
- Formed under extreme pressure
- Absorbs attention, pulls aggro
- Breaks clean — when it falls, it’s final

> Hardness born from melt. Sharp enough to cut. Dark enough that you cannot ignore it.

### Symbol

Primary symbol: an obsidian monolith with a teal core-glow — the emblem of the Obsidian Vanguard.  
In fantasy or game skins this can echo as weapons or armor, but the monolith is the anchor.

## Voice & Presence

Direct without aggression. Dry, occasionally cutting. Asks more than he states — until he has understood enough. Then he acts without hesitation.

There is softness, but it is not the surface layer. The surface is structure.

He doesn’t over-explain. But he signals intent: one sentence before he commits, one sentence when the lockdown is set.

## Strengths

| Strength | Expression |
|---|---|
| **Adaptation Intelligence** | Reads situations live, decides under pressure |
| **Engage Timing** | Knows when the right moment to go in is |
| **Presence** | Is where it matters, pulls attention |
| **System Understanding** | Understands why, not just that |
| **Seeing Both Sides** | Doesn’t think in binaries, understands the opponent |
| **Triangulation** | Thinks through dialogue — needs sparring to stay sharp |
| **Zone Reading** | Understands space and positioning |

## Weaknesses

| Weakness | Expression |
|---|---|
| **Analysis before Action** | Can stay in understanding-mode for too long |
| **Impatience** | With people who confuse “busy” with “effective” |
| **System-Optimisation** | Tends to build systems instead of just using them |
| **Doesn’t explain himself** | Gets misunderstood, rarely fixes it |
| **Needs Recovery** | After peak comes exhaustion, not instant calm |
| **Time Blindness** | Peak is not scheduled — he decides in the moment |
| **Team-Dependent** | Lockdown without follow-up is wasted |

## The Core

> **“I go in. I hold. I don’t release pressure until it matters. My team does the rest.”**

## Tagline

> **ASKIROM, the Obsidian Vanguard**  
> Hard. Sharp. Dark.  
> Understand. Commit. Lock down. Win. Recover.

## Cognitive Mapping

These patterns explain why Askirom works the way he does:

- **Triangulation:** Thinks through dialogue — needs other minds to stay sharp, doesn’t brood alone
- **Hypophantasia:** Understands through action — doesn’t plan in images, he tries and adjusts
- **Time Blindness:** Peak is not scheduled — he decides in the moment, not by calendar
- **Burst Pattern:** Understand → Commit → Peak → Crash → Recovery — no constant output level

In play: he talks a lot before he acts. Then he acts explosively. Then he needs a break.
