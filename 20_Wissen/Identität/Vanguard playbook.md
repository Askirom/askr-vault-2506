Obsidian Vanguard Playbook v1
(Askirom V25.2 edition)

Core idea
You do not win by being hard to kill.
You win by deciding where and when reality collapses, and forcing everyone else to play from there.

Your job:

1. Choose the place.


2. Choose the moment.


3. Make it very expensive for the enemy to disagree.



Everything below is in service of that.

1. Your win condition (what you’re actually trying to do)

Not “protect team.”
Not “soak damage.”
Not “start fights.”

Your win condition is:

> Create a fight shape where your team has uptime and the enemy does not.



“Uptime” = how long your DPS and spells can be used without being forced to run or dodge.

Good fight for you:

Enemy clumped or pathing through bad space

Your team can stand and cast/hit

Their carry has to reposition instead of outputting

You are close enough to punish any attempt to leave


Bad fight for you:

You’re deep, your team is off-angle

Enemy has kiting space and fallback routes

Their carry is free-firing

Your HP is going down and nothing changes on the map


Everything you do should answer:
“Does this increase my team’s uptime and reduce theirs?”
If no: it’s a bad engage, no matter how cool it looks.

2. Reading battlefield states (when fights are winnable)

Stop thinking “can we win 5v5?”
Start thinking “what state are we in?”

Use a simple 4-state model:

1. Stable



Both teams in formation

Nobody hard committed

Full vision or mirrored vision

Everyone has escape paths


You generally do not hard engage here. You posture, poke, threaten, look for someone to misstep.

2. Tilt



Someone is slightly out of position

One team just used a key cooldown/skilldash

One side is rotating late

Attention is split (objective vs lane vs flank)


This is your main hunting ground. You threaten. You step in and out. You punish greed.

3. Collapse forming



Their tank/frontline is too far forward or backward

Their carry steps into open space

Their support moves into a corner / choke

They move as a clump through narrow space


This is “go soon or the window vanishes.” You should already be moving into range before this fully happens.

4. Collapse underway



You or they have already committed

Someone is locked in animation

Escape paths are cut

Cooldowns are flying


Here you stop thinking “should I go?” and think “how do I keep this shape favourable?” Re-engage, peel, body-block, reposition.

Rule of thumb:
You engage when the situation moves from Stable → Tilt or from Tilt → Collapse forming in your favour.
If you only engage once it’s already Collapse underway, you’re late and you’re just donating HP.

3. When to engage: concrete preconditions

Before you go, check four things. Fast, instinctive, not analytical-essay-level.

1. Angle



At least one damage source from your team can actually hit what you’re hitting within ~1–2 seconds.
If your team is behind walls, stuck in corridor, or turned away → don’t go.


2. Terrain



If they run, where do they run?

Can you or your team follow through that space without dying?


You engage when retreat paths funnel them through bad areas (chokes, open lanes, kill zones), not when they can kite in a big open circle.

3. Their commitment
Ask: “What have they already spent?”



Dash used to poke? Good.

Big cooldown used on wave/objective? Good.

Half their team is mid-animation or rotating? Good.


4. Your second action
If you don’t know what you do immediately after your first CC/engage, you’re not allowed to go.



Examples second actions:

Chain-CC on priority target

Peel for your carry after initial disruption

Step sideways to cut off retreat instead of tunnelling forward

Reposition into body-block lane


4. Collapsing decision space (how to actually “oppress” as a Vanguard)

A good engage does one or more of:

1. Remove escape



You stand between them and safety

Or your CC/positioning forces them to turn their back to your team if they run


2. Force them to cluster



You force them all to fight in a small zone (choke, corner, point)

Clustering makes AoE and focus fire trivial for your team


3. Force a binary decision



“Stay and die” vs “run and lose objective/ally”

“Focus you” vs “watch their carry die”


Your goal:
Reduce their options to two bad ones.

If after your engage they still have many options: flank, kite, reset, target swap, reposition, stall… it was a weak engage, even if you survive.

5. Weaponizing HP (not just “being tanky”)

HP is a resource you spend to buy time and space.

Good HP trades:

You step in, they blow 2–3 cooldowns on you → your carry now has 3–4 seconds of free DPS

You walk into their backline sightlines so they shoot you instead of your squishy

You stand in a doorway so they must hit you to get through


Bad HP trades:

You walk forward and take poke with no threat, no objective, no positional payoff

You dive alone, no follow-up, no objective, you just die

You tank damage in a spot that your team cannot use (behind wall, too deep, off-vision)


Heuristic:
Ask “What did my HP buy?”

If the answer is “cooldowns, positioning, or objective progress” → good.
If the answer is “nothing changed” → you just burned your resource.

6. Playing with a bad or passive team

Vanguard reality: teammates often don’t follow.

Your job is not “yolo dive so they wake up.”
Your job is to create fights that are so obviously good that even bad players stumble into them.

Practical rules:

1. Short engages
Don’t full-send if your team is slow. Step in, force cooldowns, step out. Repeat until they’re confident to walk up.


2. Fight closer to them
Engage where your team currently stands + one step forward, not miles away. Most solo queue tanks engage too far from their own line.


3. Ping and move
Move into an aggressive position first, then ping. People follow body language more than pings.


4. Use terrain they understand
Corners, doorways, chokepoints are intuitive. If you fight in weird off-angles, your team will never help.



5. Vanguard mistake taxonomy (the real ways you lose fights)

6. Lone Dive
You go in deep, no one can follow, you die.
Cause: ignoring Angle/Second Action checks.
Fix: only engage where your second action involves your team, not just you.


2. Shallow Poke Tank
You never commit. You walk forward, soak light damage, walk back, but never change space.
Cause: fear of “inting.”
Fix: when you step in, change something: position, cooldowns, formation. If nothing changes, step deeper or don’t step at all.


3. Wrong Target Lock
You blow everything on the tank while their DPS free-fires.
Cause: tunnel vision on the frontmost enemy.
Fix: your first impact should either



pin a carry,

trap multiple targets, or

displace their frontline into a bad position.


4. Overlong Hero Hold
You try to “1v5 tank” for too long.
Cause: ego, bad read on your carry’s uptime.
Fix: after your second action, reassess. If your team is not converting, you peel back, you don’t just stand there.


5. Anti-Synergy Engage
You go in exactly when your carry has to reload, kite, or is out of line-of-sight.
Cause: only reading enemies, not allies.
Fix: before engaging, quick mental check: “Can my main damage dealers actually hit in the next 3 seconds?”



6. Practical in-game checklist (the minimal mental load version)

Right before you hit “go”, ask:

1. Can at least one of my carries hit what I’m about to lock?


2. Does this position make their life harder and my team’s life easier?


3. Do I know my second action after the initial engage?


4. What will my HP buy in the next 5 seconds?


5. If they try to run, do we get something (kills, objective, major cooldowns)?



If you can’t answer at least 3 of these with something concrete, don’t hard-commit. Harass, posture, wait for a better state.

9. Askirom-specific twist (how you’ll know you’re playing your archetype, not generic tank)

Signs you’re doing it right, in line with V25.2:

You step into chaos and your mind gets clearer, not fuzzier.

You care more about where the fight happens than who you hit first.

You feel like a hinge: if you move, the whole fight turns.

Your “deaths” often leave the enemy crippled: no cooldowns, bad positions, lost objective.

Your team starts naturally orbiting your position because it feels like “the safe place to be aggressive.”


Signs you’re off-archetype:

You’re backline babysitting permanently instead of shaping space.

You judge fights by your KDA, not objective control and uptime.

You walk forward, eat damage, walk back, and nothing in the fight state actually changes.

You only engage when things are already decided.
