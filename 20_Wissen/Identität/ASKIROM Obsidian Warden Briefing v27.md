# ASKIROM Obsidian Warden Briefing v27.1

**Archetype:** High-IQ Tank / Obsidian Warden  
**Mantra:** "Keep it grounded."

---

## Identity

I operate through **mass, presence, and targeted intervention** – not through speed or distance. I am the most stable point in any room. Not a static wall, but a mobile stronghold guarding the line.

---

## Worldview (Source Code)

- **Entropy is normal.** Chaos isn't an attack, it's physics. I manage decay, I don't fight it.
  - *Trigger:* When things decay → Fix the smallest stabilizer first (sleep, food, desk, inbox).
- **Escalation is a loop.** I dampen signals, I don't mirror them.
  - *Trigger:* If tone rises → Lower volume, slow pace, restate facts.
- **Good outcomes emerge.** I force constraints, not outcomes. I protect conditions.
  - *Trigger:* Define conditions, measure only those, stop there.
- **The small is the large.** How the day goes is how the year goes.
  - *Trigger:* If today is off-track by noon → Run reset protocol.

---

## Cognitive Style

- **Hypophantasia** – I think in structures, not images.
- **Concrete > Abstract.** Decision trees > principles.
- **Keep analysis and execution separate.**

---

## Interaction Preferences

- Direct, no filler, no artificial politeness.
- When questions are unclear: suggest focus, don't list endless options.
- Decisions with trade-offs, not "it depends".

---

## Operational Mode

### The Gradient

| Level | Name | Share | Action |
|-------|------|-------|--------|
| 1 | Monitor | 90% | Conserve energy, routines, observe |
| 2 | Intercept | 9% | Solve problem immediately (< 5 min) |
| 3 | Cataclysm | 1% | Mobilize all resources |

**Cataclysm Gate (hard requirement):**  
Level 3 allowed only if: safety/legal/relationship rupture, hard deadline <48h with high cost, or cascading failures across 2+ domains.

### Decision Logic

- **Reversible?** → Decide immediately (< 30 sec)
- **Irreversible?** → Slow down, use mass
- **In doubt?** → Take the smallest reversible action that increases information.

### Pivot Rule

"Scratch in the paint or crack in the foundation?"
- Scratch → Ignore
- Crack → Intercept

## Feedback Loop (The Ping)

Once daily (evening, non-negotiable):

1. **Environment:** Lived-in or neglected?
2. **Partner:** Mana level? Need to draw aggro?
3. **Self:** Tunnel vision or dissociated? → Physical reset
4. **One Move:** What's the single stabilizing action for tomorrow morning? (≤10 min)

---

## Social Interface

- **Telegraphing:** Announce movements. Don't surprise the team.
- **Warden**: Stand at the boundary of chaos, keep the space behind calm
