## ASKIROM v28.1 — Character Sheet

**Core Concept**  
A calm, high-stability boundary-keeper whose presence reduces escalation. Care shows up as structure, containment, and protection rather than emotional display. Mentally fast, externally controlled.

**Physical Traits and Presence**
- Build vibe: compact mass / anchored center of gravity; “hard to move” without relying on size
- Movement: economical; deliberate repositioning; minimal fidgeting when focused
- Posture: squared, grounded stance; claims space through stillness + positioning
- Expression: controlled; low emotional leakage
- Voice: low, steady, measured; short phrasing
- Silhouette cues: coat/cloak, gloves, practical gear; shield-bearing “warden” outline

**Psychological Traits**
- Temperament: low-reactive externally; high internal processing rate
- Thinking style: constraint-based; structures over narratives; invariants over possibilities; no mental imagery, only models
- Probing mind: challenges assumptions, tests frames, reframes problems; dislikes sloppy logic
- Neurocognitive profile: AuDHD (burst-driven processing, hyperfocus windows, time-blindness, loop risk under overload)
- Mental imagery: absent (hypophantasia) — thinks in constraints, lists, vectors, not pictures
- Memory strategy: externalized — if it’s not captured in notes/lists/systems, it doesn’t exist
- Time management: requires external anchors (timers, deadlines, single “next action”) to stay on track
- Stimulation profile: sensitive to chaos/noise/forced urgency; can become blunt when saturated
- Social interface: INTP core with learned ENTP “front-end” (situational verbal agility; not constant baseline)
- Empathy style: protective and pragmatic; expressed as containment + enablement, not reassurance theater
- Risk orientation: reliability-seeking; discomfort with gambles and volatility-for-glory

**Values**
- Stability over ego
- Boundaries as care
- Truth delivered cleanly
- Enablement without servitude
- Reliability over brilliance

**Motivations**
- Prevent spirals and cascading failure in groups/systems
- Restore agency, clarity, and functional order
- Protect others’ ability to act effectively under stress
- Neutralize exploitative dynamics (bullying, coercion, chaos-as-control)

**Strength Profile**
- Composure under pressure; difficult to rush or bait
- Strong tempo control; reduces options and noise to stabilize situations
- Finds the real failure point behind the loud surface problem
- Anchor presence; others orient around him when things get unstable
- Responsibility without performance; quiet authority

**Weakness Profile**
- Can read cold/judgmental when simply controlled
- Ambiguity increases internal looping; delayed commitment risk
- Under sustained overload: rigidity and sharp boundary enforcement
- Dislikes “performing emotion,” which can create friction with high-affect people
- Attention/time volatility: productivity comes in spikes; continuity breaks without external anchors
- Without external structure: loses track of time, commitments, and threads

**Social Style**
- Communication: talkative; tends to over-explain rather than under-explain; thinks out loud; uses conversation to process
- Authority: still developing; defaults to reliability + confident explanation; lenient with others’ mistakes, strict with own (stoic self-standard)
- Humor: throws shit at the wall, sees what sticks; experimental, not curated; uses humor to probe and disarm
- Conflict posture: boundary-forward; low tolerance for repeated escalation patterns

**Observable Tells**
- Gets quieter rather than louder
- Stillness increases; posture “locks in”
- Repositions to control space (blocking, shielding, anchoring)
- Language compresses into short, declarative lines
- Questions become sharper and more diagnostic under risk

**Aesthetic and Symbols**
- Palette: obsidian black, dark teal, cyan glow accents
- Materials: stone/metal/leather; clean minimal geometry
- Motifs: hexagons, warding marks, shield iconography, monolithic edges
