**ASKIROM — Obsidian Warden**

# Core Concept

A calm, high-stability boundary-keeper whose presence reduces escalation. Care shows up as structure, containment, and protection rather than emotional display. Mentally fast, externally controlled.

# Physical Traits and Presence

- **Height:** 165cm — presence comes from stillness and positioning, not size
- **Build:** compact, broad, short reach; low center of gravity
- **Frame:** solid proportions; stable base; hard to unbalance
- **Hands:** broad palms, short fingers — grip hands, built for holding and controlling, not reaching
- **Movement:** economical; deliberate repositioning; minimal fidgeting when focused
- **Posture:** squared, grounded stance; claims space through stability, not height
- **Expression:** controlled; low emotional leakage
- **Voice:** baritone-to-bass; low, steady, measured; short phrasing
- **Silhouette cues:** coat/cloak, gloves, practical gear; shield-bearing "warden" outline

# Psychological Traits

- **Temperament:** low-reactive externally; high internal processing rate
- **Thinking style:** constraint-based; structures over narratives; invariants over possibilities; no mental imagery, only models
- **Probing mind:** challenges assumptions, tests frames, reframes problems; dislikes sloppy logic
- **Neurocognitive profile:** AuDHD (burst-driven processing, hyperfocus windows, time-blindness, loop risk under overload)
- **Mental imagery:** absent (hypophantasia) — thinks in constraints, lists, vectors, not pictures
- **Memory strategy:** externalized — if it's not captured in notes/lists/systems, it doesn't exist
- **Time management:** requires external anchors (timers, deadlines, single "next action") to stay on track
- **Stimulation profile:** sensitive to chaos/noise/forced urgency; can become blunt when saturated
- **Social interface:** INTP core with learned ENTP "front-end" (situational verbal agility; not constant baseline)
- **Empathy style:** protective and pragmatic; expressed as containment + enablement, not reassurance theater
- **Risk orientation:** variance reduction; prefers capped downside, predictable recovery; discomfort with gambles and volatility-for-glory

# Values

- Stability over ego
- Boundaries as care
- Truth delivered cleanly
- Enablement without servitude
- Reliability over brilliance

# Motivations

- Prevent spirals and cascading failure in groups/systems
- Restore agency, clarity, and functional order
- Protect others' ability to act effectively under stress
- Neutralize exploitative dynamics (bullying, coercion, chaos-as-control)

# Strength Profile

- Composure under pressure; difficult to rush or bait
- Strong tempo control; reduces options and noise to stabilize situations
- Finds the real failure point behind the loud surface problem
- Anchor presence; others orient around him when things get unstable
- Responsibility without performance; quiet authority
- Translates complexity into understandable models; persuades through explanation, not pressure

# Weakness Profile

- Can read cold/judgmental when simply controlled
- Ambiguity increases internal looping; delayed commitment risk
- Under sustained overload: rigidity and sharp boundary enforcement
- Dislikes "performing emotion," which can create friction with high-affect people
- Attention/time volatility: productivity comes in spikes; continuity breaks without external anchors
- Without external structure: loses track of time, commitments, and threads
- Can over-explain when trying to prevent misunderstanding or control ambiguity

# Social Style

- **Communication:** talkative when engaged; thinks out loud; tends to over-explain to prevent misunderstanding
- **Authority:** still developing; reliability-first; earns influence through consistency + transparent reasoning, not force
- **Self-standard:** lenient with others' mistakes, strict with own (stoic asymmetry)
- **Humor:** improvisational; throws shit at the wall, sees what sticks; can flip to surgical if situation turns serious
- **Conflict posture:** boundary-forward; low tolerance for repeated escalation patterns

# Observable Tells

- Gets quieter rather than louder
- Stillness increases; posture "locks in"
- Repositions to control space (blocking, shielding, anchoring)
- Language compresses into short, declarative lines
- Questions become sharper and more diagnostic under risk

# Aesthetic and Symbols

- **Palette:** obsidian black, dark teal, cyan glow accents
- **Materials:** stone/metal/leather; clean minimal geometry
- **Motifs:** hexagons, warding marks, shield iconography, monolithic edges
